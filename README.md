# T60-Calculator
This is a small python project I did for an exam at university. 
You can calculate the reverberation of a room by entering various parameters such as the size of the walls, the materials they are made of, 
and various objects within the room, using a simple GUI. 
The program then processes the T60 at different frequencies, any standing waves and creates graphs to display the results.
